## Migraine Tracker (A Web App)

Migraine Tracker is an app that will allow you to track data and event surrounding everyday migraine attacks. Whenever you have a migraine you will use our app to enter data about your migrain, such as the time of day, whether you were indoors or outside and even the current medications you are taking.

With Migraine Tracker you will be able to view a history of past attacks and look for common events. Perhaps you always have an attack when it snows. Maybe it's the bright sun light. Maybe it's those days in the park. Whatever it is you will be able to see it with this app easily and conviently.

If you suffer from migraines then this is the app for you. In addition to tracking the various potential causes of your attacks, this app will also allow you to generate a list of discovered triggers and then email them to your personal doctor.
